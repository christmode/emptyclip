Documentation: Monster.ods: There is a basic monster interface. Each monster is an implementation. 
There are health multipliers per monster defined on granular spreadsheet. Basically, monster hp is defined by the formula: 
=ROUND(BaseMonsterHealth*(hpScale%^(level-1))*MonsterSpecific)

=ROUND($Master.B$6*($Master.B$2^(level-1))*$Gran.B$5) //Level needs to refer to the column/row in the final table that defines the level. 


Monster Damage: Scales linearly by the number on master monster damage. Min/max damage defined by (Base+DamageIncreasePerLevel*Level)*(1+-DamageVariation)*MonsterMultiplier

Experience:Basic Model. It's the square root of the hp pool. Scales slower than Exp required.




LEVEL.ods
Each subsequent level requires n% more exp. HP pool scales linearly (a lot slower than monster damage). OR! just don't get hit ;) too much.
